This game is sponsored exclusively by OpenAI Foundation's modell.

The game has a UI for starting a single player and also multiplayer campaign. The player is able to create a character with random stats including (but not limited to) damage, magic resist, armor and health. The opponent has a randomly generated name based on famous franchises.
It is important to note that during the battle both the player's and opponent's health decreases after taking damage but the damage is not permanent. If the player decides to start again, a new enemy will be created. The game also keeps the experience the player gathered. It is possible to extend the application so that it sends notifications regardless of the platform (iOS, Android etc.) it runs on. The settings and multiplayer menutabs are currently out of service but pressing the exit does not automatically closes the game.

In my opinion this is a good foundation to create a good game. Use it as you wish.
